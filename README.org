Library for converting first letter of Pinyin to Chinese characters.

* Functions
** =pinyinlib-build-regexp-char=
   =pinyinlib-build-regexp-char= converts a letter to a regular expression
   containing all the Chinese characters whose pinyins start with the letter.
   It accepts four parameters:
   : char &optional no-punc-p tranditional-p only-chinese-p

   The first parameter =char= is the letter to be converted. The latter three
   parameters are optional.
   - If =no-punc-p= is =t=: it will not convert English punctuations to
     Chinese punctuations.

   - If =traditional-p= is =t=: traditional Chinese characters are used instead
     of simplified Chinese characters.

   - If =only-chinese-p= is =t=: the resulting regular expression doesn't
     contain the English letter =char=.

   When converting English punctuactions to Chinese punctuations, it used the
   following table:
   | English Punctuation | Chinese & English Punctuations |
   |---------------------+--------------------------------|
   | .                   | 。.                            |
   | ,                   | ，,                            |

   | (                   | （(                            |
   | )                   | ）)                            |
   | <                   | 《<                            |

** =pinyinlib-build-regexp-string=

   It is same as =pinyinlib-build-regexp-char=, except that its first parameter
   is a string so that it can convert a sequence of letters to a regular
   expression.
